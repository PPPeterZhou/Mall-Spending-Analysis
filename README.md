# Mall-Spending-Analysis

In a shopping mall, we observe that people buy goods and services they need, but one thing you may be curious about is how do the properties (like gender, age, and income) of a person affect the spending level? In this project, we will be predicting the spending level based on the peopleâ€™s properties with machine learning algorithms including SGD Regression, K-neighbors Regression, Support Vector Machine Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
